Colcannon is the sort of food that doesn't photograph well but tastes like home. It's mashed potatoes with greens, and that's {{< colorbold "all it needs to be" >}}.

## Ingredients

- 1kg floury potatoes (Roosters or Kerr's Pinks)
- 200g curly kale, stripped from stems and chopped
- 4 spring onions, finely sliced
- 100ml milk, warmed
- 50g butter, plus extra for serving

## Method

1. Boil potatoes in salted water until tender, about 20 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, blanch the kale in boiling water for 3 minutes. Drain well.
3. Drain the potatoes and return to the pot. Mash until smooth.
4. Stir in warm milk, butter, kale, and spring onions.
5. Season generously. Serve with a well of melted butter in the centre.
