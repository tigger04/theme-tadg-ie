Soda bread is the simplest bread you can make. Four ingredients, no yeast, no kneading, no proving. From bowl to table in under an hour.

## Ingredients

- 450g plain flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 400ml buttermilk

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 200°C.
2. Mix flour, salt, and bicarbonate of soda in a large bowl.
3. Make a well in the centre and pour in the buttermilk.
4. Mix quickly with a wooden spoon — do not overwork the dough.
5. Turn onto a floured surface and shape into a round.
6. Cut a deep cross on top.
7. Bake for 35–40 minutes until the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.
