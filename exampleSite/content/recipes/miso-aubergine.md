This is the dish that makes people reconsider aubergine. The miso glaze caramelises into something deeply savoury and slightly sweet.

## Ingredients

- 2 large aubergines
- 3 tbsp white miso paste
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar
- Sesame seeds and spring onions to serve

## Method

1. Halve the aubergines lengthwise. Score the flesh in a crosshatch pattern.
2. Mix miso, mirin, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar.
3. Brush the flesh side with half the glaze.
4. Place cut-side down on a baking tray. Roast at 200°C for 20 minutes.
5. Flip, brush with remaining glaze, and roast for another 15 minutes.
6. Scatter with sesame seeds and sliced spring onions.
