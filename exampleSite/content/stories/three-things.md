I bought a compass at a market in Galway. It was brass, heavy, and completely unreliable. It pointed south-southwest regardless of where you stood. I kept it anyway.

{{< details "Thing one: certainty is overrated" >}}
The compass was wrong, but it was consistently wrong. After a while, I learned to compensate. I knew that wherever it pointed, north was roughly 200 degrees the other way. A broken instrument you understand is more useful than a working one you don't.

{{< details "Thing two: all tools are extensions of intention" >}}
The compass didn't find north. *I* found north, using the compass as a reference point. The tool didn't do the work — it gave me something to push against. Most tools work this way, if you're honest about it.

I still have the compass. It sits on a shelf next to a clock that runs fast and a pen that skips. These objects remind me that imperfection is not the same as uselessness.
