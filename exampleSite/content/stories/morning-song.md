A demonstration of the poem shortcode, which preserves line breaks exactly as written.

{{< poem >}}
The kettle clicks.
Outside, a blackbird
tests the morning
with three cautious notes.

Light finds the table,
the crumbs from last night,
the book left open
at the page where sleep arrived.

There is no hurry.
The day will assemble itself
from these small,
unhurried pieces.
