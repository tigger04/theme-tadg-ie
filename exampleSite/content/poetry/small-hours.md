{{< poem >}}
The fridge hums its one note.
A tap drips in the dark
like a clock that forgot
what it was counting.

You stand at the window.
The street is all amber
and nothing. A cat
crosses the road
with tremendous purpose.

You pour the milk.
You drink the milk.
You go back to bed
knowing nothing has changed
but something has shifted.
