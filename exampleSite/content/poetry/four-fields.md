{{< poem >}}
The first field is the one you crossed at seven,
grass to the waist, the dog ahead.
The second is the one you saw from the train,
gold in September, already someone else's.

The third field you walked through arguing.
The rain came. You kept arguing.
The fourth field is the one you dream about:
flat, enormous, and always just behind you.
