{{< poem >}}
At low tide the harbour empties
to mud and the ribs of old boats.
The water goes out like a secret
someone decided to keep.

We sat on the wall and ate chips.
The vinegar stung a cut on my thumb.
You said something about the future.
The gulls were not interested.

The tide came back, as tides do,
and covered everything
we had been looking at.
