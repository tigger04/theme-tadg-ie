{{< poem >}}
She drew the roads from memory,
the river where it used to run,
the bridge they took down in the nineties.

She marked the shop that sold paraffin,
the tree where the owl sat every January,
the gap in the wall you could squeeze through
if you were ten and determined.

None of this was on any official map.
All of it was true.
